# MapEditor
In an attempt to help with programming game levels, I created a map editor that would allow me to import and export map files into my games. Although never complete, much of the base functionality was there. This was written in Java my senior year.

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Exporting and importing files
- Exporting objects so they can be read and saved properly
- Sprites
- Gui and graphics in one window
